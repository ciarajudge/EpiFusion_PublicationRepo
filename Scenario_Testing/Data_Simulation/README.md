# Scenario Testing - Data Simulation Process
This folder contains details on how the data was generated for each of the simulated scenarios included in the manuscript.

## Data Index
This will also be included in the Data folder where the final datasets are stored but for ease of understanding, here is an index of every simulated dataset:

| Dataset Identifier | Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- | ----------- |
| baseline | main_scenarios | Simple intro of pathogen to immune naive population |
| sampling | main_scenarios | Introduction of pathogen to immune naive population with low sampling initially |
| transmission | main_scenarios | Increase in transmissibility of an endemic pathogen |

## Generating the datasets
The R code used to generate these datasets (any pre and post processing steps) is in `Data_Simulation.Rmd`.
