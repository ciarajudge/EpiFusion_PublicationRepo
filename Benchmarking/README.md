# Benchmarking

For the benchmarking section we compared the performance of BDSky, EpiNow2 and TimTam on the datasets from the Scenario Testing section to the combined EpiFusion models on the same datasets. The code used including R code for EpiNow2, and BEAST XML files for TimTam and BDSky, are in their respective folders along with the results of the analyses.
