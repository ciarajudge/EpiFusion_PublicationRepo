# Data Simulation Process
This folder contains details on how the data was generated for each of the simulated scenarios included in the manuscript.

## Data Index
This will also be included in the Data folder where the final datasets are stored but for ease of understanding, here is an index of every simulated dataset:

### 'Scenario' Datasets
* Introduction-Scenario

* Transmission-Scenario

### 'Noise' Datasets
* No-noise
